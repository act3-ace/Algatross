The Ascension Team core library for Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MO-MARL) in PyTorch.

Features:

* Total algorithm customization from .yaml files.
* Total integration with [Ray](https://www.ray.io/) library for highly scalable training and inference.
* Fast and stable distributed implementation of Multi-objective Asymmetric Island Model (MO-AIM) proposed by [Dixit and Tumer (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583131.3590524).
* Integration with Heterogeneous-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HARL) proposed by [Zhong et al. (2024)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09870).
* Baseline implementations for PPO in RLlib and CleanRL.
* Distributed plotting and visualization for supported environments.
* Native filesystem-based multi-agent checkpoints. Navigate archipelago checkpoints entirely in a file browser.
